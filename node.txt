Previously, we've been using a combination of html, css, and javascript to run javascript in the browser
javascript always had to be connected by a script tag, and the page runs on the client side
in my web browser

At some point, people wanted to make something that can run javascript without the need for a browser
and running javascript, potentially, as a server sided technology

Node comes with NPM (node package manager) which allows us to install new dependencies for our project
such as the ones we will be using

npm init: will initialize a project using npm and walk us through some setup

typescript: the main thing that TS added for us is strongly typed functionality
typescript must be first transpiled to js using the tsc command
a few more things:
-interfaces (a guarantee of certain behavior.. oftentimes referred to as a contract of behavior)
    -in TS, it is especially used for mandating that data is organized in a certain way (contains certain variables etc)
-access modifiers
    -public (default)
    -private (only access within class)
    -protected (only accessed within class or by children of this class)
-decorators (like annotations in java)
